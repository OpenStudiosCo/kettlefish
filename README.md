# What is this

Kettlefish is a very simple boilerplate for fussy lazy web devs.

# Features
- Simple low maintenance configuration, works out of the box.
- [Pug for HTML templates](https://pugjs.org/)
- [Stylus for CSS](http://stylus-lang.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) frameworks included
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for ES2015, application development and compression
- Example sites for even faster site building (coming soon)

# How to use Kettlefish
If you're aware of some or all of the buzzwords in the features list, you're going to have a good time with this boilerplate. If not, feel free to post issues asking how to do things unrelated to this project.

Out of the box, you can start a new site using this as a base - you'll have everything you need to do anything. If you're a CMS developer, you can use this to implement a design first and then integrate it into your development pipeline.

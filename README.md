# Getting Started
Kettlefish is a very simple boilerplate for fussy lazy web devs.

[Demo](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/paulbrzeski/kettlefish/blob/master/index.html)

# Features
- Simple low maintenance configuration, works out of the box.
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) for HTML.
  - The [templates](/src/templates) folder contains page layouts, scripts blocks, etc and the [pages](/src/pages) folder creates the HTML structure of the site at the root, this is why there's a rogue index.html file in this repository. 
- [Stylus for CSS](http://stylus-lang.com/)
  - The [styles](/src/styles) folder compiles into CSS, as you'll note in the `css` script below, any files defined in `/src/styles` are compiled to CSS in `/dist`.
- Example sites for even faster site building (coming soon)
  - For now, I've re-implemented the Semantic UI homepage demo using Kettlefish - [demo here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/paulbrzeski/kettlefish/blob/master/index.html).

# How to use Kettlefish
If you're aware of some or all of the buzzwords in the features list, you're going to have a good time with this boilerplate. If not, feel free to post issues asking how to do things unrelated to this project.

Kettlefish is a multi purpose static site generator.

Out of the box, you can start a new site using this as a base - you'll have everything you need to do anything. If you're a CMS developer, you can use this to implement a design first and then integrate it into your development pipeline.

## Usage
